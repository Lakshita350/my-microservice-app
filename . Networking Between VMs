To connect the microservices on the two VMs, you need to configure VM networking:

    Get the IP Address of VM1:
    Run this on VM1:

ifconfig   # Or `ip a` to get the IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.10)

Access the Microservice from VM2:
Modify the service in VM2 to call VM1â€™s microservice using its IP address:

    import requests
    response = requests.get('http://192.168.1.10:8081')
    print(response.text)

    Firewall and Port Configuration:
    Ensure ports 8081 and 8082 are open on both VMs.

5. Deployment Steps on Each VM

    SSH into each VM.

    Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-microservice-app.git
cd my-microservice-app/deployment/vm1

Build and run the Docker containers:

    docker-compose up --build -d

    Repeat the same for VM2 with the appropriate docker-compose.yml.

6. Sample Communication Between VMs

Once deployed, you can access the services:

    VM1: http://<VM1-IP>:8081
    VM2: http://<VM2-IP>:8082

Example request from VM1 to VM2:

response = requests.get('http://<VM2-IP>:8082')
print(response.text)
